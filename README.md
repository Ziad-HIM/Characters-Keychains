# Characters-Keychains
Don't they look Amazing? Initially, I wasn’t planning on making keychains—I was just creating regular pixel art models of characters. But then it occurred to me that these 3D models could be printed out and used in different ways. I thought, why not turn them into keychains or even cool earrings?
